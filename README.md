# GE Filters

Adds a set of filters to the Grand Exchange search interface. 

Some filters have multiple options which can be accessed by right clicking the filter.

**Filters**
* Bank Tags - Filter by bank tags, requires the Bank Tags plugin to be enabled.
* Inventory Setups - Filter by Inventory Setups, requires the Inventory Setups plugin to be enabled.
* Inventory Items - Filter by current inventory or equipped items.
* Recent Items - Filter by recently viewed items or recent buy/sell offers.

**More Info**

You can enable/disable each filter in the config menu.

The recent items filter will only keep track of your recent items when turned on.

**Configuration**

By default, every Bank Tag is included in the Bank Tags filter. To include/exclude tags, you can right-click the tag in the bank interface and select the corresponding menu option.

By default, every Inventory Setup is included in the Inventory Setups filter. To include/exclude setups, right-click the Worn Equipment button in the bank interface (where you typically view setups) and use the submenu to include/exclude setups.

Note: Changing the name of a Bank Tag or Inventory Setup will require you to configure that tag/setup again.


**Compatibility**

This plugin is fully compatible with the Grand Exchange plugin and Quest Helper's quest item filter.

# GE Filters

Adds a set of filters to the Grand Exchange search interface. 

Some filters have multiple options which can be accessed by right clicking the filter.

**Filters**
* Bank Tags - Filter by bank tags, requires the Bank Tags plugin to be enabled.
* Inventory Items - Filter by current inventory or equipped items.
* Recent Items - Filter by recently viewed items or recent buy/sell offers.

**More Info**

You can enable/disable each filter in the config menu.

The recent items filter will only keep track of your recent items when turned on.

By default, every bank tag is included in the Bank Tags filter. To include/exclude tags in the filter you can right click the tag in the bank interface and select the corresponding menu option.


**Compatability**

This plugin is fully compatible with the Grand Exchange plugin and Quest Helper's quest item filter.
